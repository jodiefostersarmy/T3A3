## Professional, ethical and legal obligations

### Delivery

Delivering the project on time requires the developer to manage their time based on project objectives and timelines. Based on the project, it will be useful to determine what kind of approach the team/developer will need to meet the style of personalities are involved, whether it be a traditional Waterfall method or a more modern Agile approach. Waterfall approach is a linear approach as opposed to Agile, which can be done either by Scrum or Kanban methodologies. 

For this project, there is a CI/CD pipeline implemented, which means that code is constantly tested and ensured that it is always in a deplyable state. This is also apart of the Agile approach, which means that if there is a time to market, a basic version of that app can be developed, and further improvements can be built into the app in successive iterations.
