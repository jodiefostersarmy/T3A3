## Professional, ethical and legal obligations

### Delivery

Delivering the project on time requires the developer to manage their time based on project objectives and timelines. Based on the project, it will be useful to determine what kind of approach the team/developer will need to meet the style of personalities are involved, whether it be a traditional Waterfall method or a more modern Agile approach. Waterfall approach is a linear approach as opposed to Agile, which can be done either by Scrum or Kanban methodologies. 

For this project, there is a CI/CD pipeline implemented, which means that code is constantly tested and ensured that it is always in a deplyable state. This is also apart of the Agile approach, which means that if there is a time to market, a basic version of that app can be developed, and further improvements can be built into the app in successive iterations.


### Maintenance

Maintenence will be dependant on user/customer feedback, a new feature added to the application, or updated software. The code will inevitably change as it moves through its life, which is why it is especially important to write good, clean, maintainable code. 

Having well documented code, that explains itself that can be flexible should be the aim for every programmer as different teams will by cycled through the app project and they will need to pick up where the last developer left off as smoothly as possible.

This may ask for the implementation of "the boy scout rule", which is to leave the code better than you found it. It could be renaming a variable to make more sense, or grouping functionality into methods or writing an extra unit test to create a more robust function so that it can be deployed.

### Ethical

Aside from following the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct by the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics), there needs to be a balance between collecting enough information for data around the user's interactions inside the application and also personally identifiable information. 

The main ethical concerns would be to explain to the users how their information will be used, this provides them with the choice of whether or not they want to use the app. This generally will come at a cost for some functionality, as security layers are added, so are more authentication and authorization from the user. These are tenets from the Code of Ethics by the ACM; _1.6 Respect Privacy_ and also _1.7 Honor Confidentiality_.

### Legal Obligations

Depending on where the app is available in the world, there will be different legal obligations criteria that they must meet.

In Australia, it is mandatory that there must be a **privacy policy** clearly expressed. In this privacy policy, they must cover options for anonymity of users, when they can collect personal information, how they will handle unsolicited personal information, or outline the circumstances that they can disclose a user's personal information.

Among these policies, is the outline of the steps the app must take to protect a user's personal information from misuse, interference from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
